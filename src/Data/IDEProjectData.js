      "Birdy是一个设计用于唤起用户与生物互动的触感体验的音响，而不是一个几何物体。用户可以使用这只顶部的鸟形雕塑来管理他们的音乐播放。通过在不同方向摆动它，用户可以调整音量，跳到下一首或前一首歌曲等。除了音乐播放功能之外，Birdy还可以作为智能家居助手，以鸟叫声作为回应。其目标是创造更自然和情感上吸引人的用户体验。",

      "Birdy is a speaker that is designed to evoke a tactile and interactive experience with a creature, rather than a geometric object. With intuitive controls, users can manage their music playback by using the bird as a game stick. By swinging it in different directions, users can adjust the volume, skip to the next or previous song, and more. In addition to its music-playing capabilities, Birdy also doubles as a smart home assistant that responds to various bird calls. Its aim is to create a more natural and emotionally engaging user experience.",

      "The design of Birdy is inspired by the way bird breeders often stroke and interact with their pets. The bird is located at the top and the bottom is a conical speaker. It is designed to foster emotional connections between users and the device, creating a more natural and seamless user experience.",
      "Birdy provides a more engaging way to control music playback. With its bird-shaped game stick, users can interact with their music in a unique and interesting way, making the experience feel more natural and intuitive. Designed to emulate the experience of touching and interacting with a live creature, Birdy provides a refreshing departure from traditional, lifeless speakers.",

      "科技能够让我们的生活变得更好，但是现在我们处在这样一种情况，那就是我们控制所有物品都是通过一种东西——屏幕。虽然屏幕非常直观与方便，但是每天出玻璃打交道太过无聊了。我们需要一些不一样的东西，重新利用我们的手，我们的触觉、嗅觉，而不是通过手机或其他屏幕。所以我的目标是设计一种物理体验，当你听音乐时能够与之进行有趣的互动。",
      "Technology can make our lives better, but currently we are in a situation where we control everything through one thing - screens. Although screens are intuitive and convenient, dealing with glass all day can be boring. We need something different, something that allows us to use our hands, our sense of touch and smell, instead of relying on phones or other screens. So, my goal is to design a physical experience that allows for interesting interaction while listening to music.",
      "That's why I created Flipping, a Bluetooth speaker that can be switched songs by flipping it. Through a small interaction, it provides listeners with a unique user experience.",

      "The current prototype construction of wearable and electronic textile products involves the use of conductive yarn for sewing, enabling electrical connections for electronic components. However, troubleshooting and debugging after sewing can be problematic, and traditional embedded rapid prototyping tools are not suitable for this field. At the same time, the Lilypad Arduino development board and modules are gradually unable to meet the needs of makers, artists, and school classes. ",
      "To address these issues, we introduced OpenWear: a toolkit for rapid prototyping and validation of wearable projects. OpenWear consists of three components: ",
      "(1) OpenWear Core, which is an ESP-32 based development board that replaces the Lilypad; ",
      "(2) OpenWear Module, a collection of electronic modules with sensors and actuators; and ",
      "(3) OpenWear Thread, which connects the Core and Module. Along with an online wiki website and fully open sourced the hardware design. We embed magnets on the PCBs of the Core and Module, allowing them to be fixed to textiles. The connection is ensured by O-ring wire terminals at both ends of the Thread, ensuring fast connectivity.",
