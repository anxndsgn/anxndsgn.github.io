      "The ages of 6-15 are the golden period for children's career enlightenment. However, surveys show that children begin to show their personalities and interests around the age of 3. As parents, we need to help our children stimulate their potential and strengths and carry out simple and appropriate career cognition training. We chose children aged 5-10 and designed according to their cognitive levels and interests. The platform is mainly divided into two parts:",
      "Career Experience - Unlock relevant occupations one by one according to the game plot, and complete the specified career tasks.",
      'City Observation - Using AR virtual reality combination to enrich the visual information of the "city sandbox". When the city faces a crisis, children must choose suitable professions to solve city problems. This helps children understand the importance of various different jobs and work for cities and societies from a macro perspective.',
      "When designing Kireer, we carefully designed interactive high-fidelity prototypes. At the same time, we also used tools such as Spline and Stable Diffusion to assist in our design.",

      "TouchSee is an application designed to enhance the sensory experience of photos for the blind and low visions. By utilizing the segmentation anything model (SAM) and saliency prediction model, users can explore every detail of a photo through distinct vibration frequencies on their smartphones. Coupled with the combination of Large Language Models (LLM) and Text-to-Speech (TTS), users are able to receive detailed descriptions of the images. ",
      "The design of TouchSee is different from regular interaction design in that we need to design according to the habits of the blind. Regular individuals can quickly access most information on the screen with their eyes, while blind individuals interact linearly, from top to bottom. Therefore, we carefully designed the information architecture to make the user experience smoother for the visually impaired group.",
